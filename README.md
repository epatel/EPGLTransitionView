This project creates an OpenGL ES view that is used to create a disappearing 
transition of a view.

The effect is implemented in a delegate that will be called for drawing
the animation.

The FlipReader demo uses iPad in landscape to view a pdf with swipe gestures
for page turning.

Please note that the pdf in the FlipReader demo is the classical programming
book Thinking Forth by Leo Brodie.
